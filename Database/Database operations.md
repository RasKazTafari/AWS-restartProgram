Task 1: Task 1: Connect to a database
In this task, you connect to an instance containing a database client, which is used to connect to a database. This instance is referred to as the Command Host.

The database operations team has created a relational database called world containing three tables: city, country, and countrylanguage. You have to validate the configuration of the database by running INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements on the country table.
